# My Drawer

My Drawer is a simple application that allows you to keep track of your knick knacks and doodads, with the option to find stores near you that carry said items. This was built over the course of 2.5 weeks nightly for the 2020 Fall Code With Friends.

## Installation

I wouldn't reccomend installing this project just yet, as it is incomplete, however if you wish to try it out, you can clone this repo onto your machine and run the xcworkspace file after updating your pods.

## Challenges and Thoughts

This was my first time working on an IoS application that has a bit of bredth, so it was very much a learning experience. I decided to test my skills by implementing Core Data for data persistance, full CRUD functionality for all objects, as well integrating the Google Maps API and Core Location for map based shenanigans.

I would often find myself working though arcane errors (And many an xcode bug!) which significantly slowed my development process down, but all in all I had a blast learning more about IoS development, and I am looking forward to continuing to sharpen my skills!

There are MANY things I would have chosen to do differently had I more time, and a more wholistic understanding of ios best practices, and I plan to go back and refactor the code to suit those paradigms.


## Roadmap

There are a few bits of polish and core functionality that I would like to get to, including the Project Creation view's doodad picker, that lets you associate your doodad objects with projects. The initial code is there, but definitely requires another pass before the functionality can be considered "Done".

The second major addition would be a complete overhaul of the UI. There was ~0% energy and time spent to making this project look pretty with correct contraints for UI elements. I typically save that for the end, after all the data is flowing correctly, and the functionality is complete.

## Conclusions

I had a blast working on this project this month and I am looking forward to the next CWF! I am looking to continue sharpening my IoS development skills to possibly transition into mobile development sometime soon.

Shout out to group 19 for being an awesome check in group!
